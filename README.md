# Creating A Rails Form

This project is about creating a form in pure HTML and reform it by using the form_tag helper and form_with helper in Rails.

The form created in this project includes username, email, password, and submit. This form allows you to create new instances and save them in a table. Also, it enables you to edit the information of users on the table.

The form raises an error when a field is empty.
